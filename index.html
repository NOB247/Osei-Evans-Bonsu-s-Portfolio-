  <h1>Osei Evans Bonsu – Level 100 STS Observation Portfolio</h1>

  <p>
    This portfolio presents my field observation experience as part of the
    <strong>Supporting Teachers in School (STS)</strong> program. As a Level 100
    student teacher, I was assigned to <strong>Akrokerri D/A JHS</strong>, where I observed
    classroom routines, teaching methods, and learner interactions. The videos and
    images displayed here provide a visual record of my learning journey,
    highlighting the skills, insights, and professional exposure gained during
    this foundational phase of my teacher education.
